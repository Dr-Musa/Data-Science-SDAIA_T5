# Project proposal
## Project Topic:	Sing Language
### Names:	Eng. Musa Ghazwani
### Abdulaziz Abuhaimed


* ## Overview:
* ## There were various technological improvements, as well as much research, to assist the deaf and dumb. Deep learning and computer vision can also be utilized to help with the cause. This can be extremely useful for deaf and dumb people in interacting with others, as understanding sign language is not something that everyone has. Furthermore, this can be extended to building automatic editors, where a person can easily write using only their hand movements.

* ## Goals:
## In purpose of this project is to create sign language recognition. We will develop this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.

* ## Data:
## Using our webcam with OpenCV, we will collect images for deep learning. Create a Sign Language model with the help of LSTM layers and Action Detection.

## Tools:
###	• Python
###	• Jupyter
### •	NumPy
### •	cv2 (OpenCV)
### •	Keras 
### •	Tensorflow
